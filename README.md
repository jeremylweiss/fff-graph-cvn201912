# fff-graph-cvn201912
R project to create a time series graph of dates of the first fall freeze for the three American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) in Arizona, as used in the 2019 December issue of the Climate Viticulture Newsletter:
https://cals.arizona.edu/research/climategem/content/climate-viticulture-newsletter-2019-december#firstfallfreeze

First fall freeze is defined as the first day between August 1 and December 31 of the same calendar year when the daily minimum temperature is less than 0 degrees Celsius.

To recreate the graph, run the 'az_ava_fff_time_series.R' script.
